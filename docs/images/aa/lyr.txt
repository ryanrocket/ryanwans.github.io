shutting me down, wake up from rem
i had a dream of us both laying in bed
when i woke up i thought that it was real
i tried to get back to sleep to get a feel
of what it was like again to see your eyes
i knew it was impossible if i tried
now im just laying here, eyelids open
i stare into darkness tryna see objects
the only thing i see is my closet ahead
the same one that bears a certain tutleneck
the same closet thats got my *** encaged
the same closet thats got my locked up 12 ***
and here all these nights i spend alone
turn off the lights, open windows
jump into bed, plug in my phone
when I still got 90% left to go
and i fall sleep, but before i do
i sit silence for an hour or two
these vivid thoughts get into view
and this what it sounds like when I dream of you
