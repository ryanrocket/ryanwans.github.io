This is the blog portion of my website. Here I can discuss all sorts of topics ranging from mathematics to electrical and RF engineering. I typically post about topics I'm interested in or about recent updates to my research. If you would like to comment on a post or reach out for any other reasons, feel free to reach me at [blog@ryanwans.com](mailto:blog@ryanwans.com)
