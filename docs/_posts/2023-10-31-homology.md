Exploring the connections between differential forms, Stokes' theorem, and multivariable calculus through the lens of cohomology.

My recent courseload and personal studies have led me to exploring some of the intersections between analysis, linear algebra, and multivariable calculus. Thankfully, my MVC professor is very enthused about these topics as well and was willing to discuss some of the following exposition with me. What follows are some brief connections between the aforementioned subjects through my discovery of differential forms in analysis and subsequent connection to the generalized Stokes' theorem. 

<blockquote>
<b>Theorem (Stokes', Generalized).</b> For some manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial M$ and $k$-form $\omega$, we have that
$$\int_M d\omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega.$$
</blockquote>

This can be viewed ultimately as a generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus; that is, the integral of the derivative of a function is equal to evaluating the behavior of said function at its boundary.
