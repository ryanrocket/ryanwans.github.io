While studying, I stumbled upon this interesting quality of the binomial distribution. 

<blockquote>
<b>Proposition.</b> Given $X \sim B(n, p)$ and $np \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have that 
$$
\mathbb{E}[X] = \text{Median}(X) = \text{Mode}(X) = np.
$$
</blockquote>

This is a very interesting property of the binomial distribution. It is clear that the expected value of $X$ is $np$, but the fact that the median and mode are also $np$ is quite intriguing. I will provide a proof of this proposition... eventually. My guess is that the case where $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ is trivial, but I will have to think about the case where $p \notin \mathbb{Z}$. ~~Updates to come~~. I now have a proof for this.

<proof>
<i>Proof.</i> 
We will start by examining the case for $0 < p < 1$, and evaluate the boundary points at the end. First, we define the mode for any distribution 

$$
\renewcommand{\P}[1]{\mathbb{P}\left[ #1 \right]}
\text{Mode}(X) = \max_{k\in\text{Supp}(X)}\left\{ \P{X = k} \right\}.
$$

We will use a ratio of consecutive probabilities as used in $[1]$ to prove that $k = np$ has the largest probability. Let $k \in \text{Supp}(X)$ and $q = 1 - p$. We have that
$$
\renewcommand{\P}[1]{\mathbb{P}\left[ #1 \right]}
    \frac{\P{X = k}}{\P{X = k - 1}} \equiv 
    \frac{\displaystyle \binom{n}{k}p^kq^{n-k}}{\displaystyle \binom{n}{k-1}p^{k-1}q^{n-k+1}} = 
    \frac{(k-1)p}{kq}.
$$
When $k \leq np$ this value is greater than 1, and when $k \geq np + 1$ it is less than 1. In other words, values before and after $np$ are less likely to occur, meaning $np$ has the largest probability. Thus, we have that $\text{Mode}(X) = np$, as confirmed in $[1]$.  We continue into the portion of the proof which is flawed; establishing the median. The median of any distribution is given by the value $k$ for which
$$
\renewcommand{\P}[1]{\mathbb{P}\left[ #1 \right]}
\P{X \geq k} \geq \frac{1}{2},\quad \P{X \leq k} \geq \frac{1}{2}.
$$
This can be interpreted as the point $k$ at which the probability of $n$ being greater than or less than $k$ is equal, and equal to one half. Observe the following;
$$
\renewcommand{\P}[1]{\mathbb{P}\left[ #1 \right]}
\sum_{r=0}^{np}\P{X = r} = \sum_{r=0}^{n(p-q)}\P{X = r} + \sum_{k=1}^{nq}\P{X = np - k + 1}. \tag{1}
$$
We are splitting the discrete sum $0 \to np$ into $0 \to n(p-q) > 0$ and $n(p-q) + 1 \to np$. 
<blockquote>
<b>Claim.</b> We make that claim that, given $p \geq q$,

$$
\renewcommand{\P}[1]{\mathbb{P}\left[ #1 \right]}
\P{X = np + k} < \P{X = np - k + 1}
$$
for some $k \in [1, nq]$. 
</blockquote>

Given this, it would then follow from equation $(1)$ that
$$
\renewcommand{\P}[1]{\mathbb{P}\left[ #1 \right]}
\sum_{r=0}^{np}\P{X = r} > \sum_{k=1}^{nq}\P{X = np + k} = \sum_{r=np+1}^n \P{X = r}, \tag{2}
$$
which is equivalent to proving the first half of the median condition.
