Observing the behavior of $B(n, p)$ for $np \in \mathbb{Z}$.

While studying, I stumbled upon this interesting quality of the binomial distribution. 

<blockquote>
<b>Proposition.</b> Given $X \sim B(n, p)$ for $np \in \mathbb{Z}$, we have that 
$$
\mathbb{E}[X] = \text{Median}(X) = \text{Mode}(X) = np.
$$
</blockquote>

This is a very interesting property of the binomial distribution. It is clear that the expected value of $X$ is $np$, but the fact that the median and mode are also $np$ is quite intriguing. I will provide a proof of this proposition... eventually. My guess is that the case where $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ is trivial, but I will have to think about the case where $p \notin \mathbb{Z}$. Updates to come.
