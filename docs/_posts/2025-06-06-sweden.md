A quick intermediary review of a month-long visit to Sweden as an undergraduate.

My first 72 hours after arriving here in Stockholm, SE were some of the most overwhelming I've experienced. I had so much I wanted to do, to see, and to experience, with what felt like no time do it all. It was almost paralyzing; I sat idly in my room, pondering what it was I wanted to do, without actually going out to do anything. To make matters worse, the expectations I set upon myself were two-fold -- I wanted to experience as much of Stockholm as possible, all while maintaining my rate of research and learning I had set forth in the spring. 

In my view, this is the most commom conundrum faced by students starting their study abroad experiences, irrespective of the destination. In this article, I want to address how I've come to handle it and make the most of my time here in Stockholm. More specifically, I'm doing to address libraries and places to learn, getting around the city, meeting new people, and the overall affordability.

### Libraries & Facilities
I've come to find that there are many, <i>many</i> freely accessible libraries and study spaces throughout the city. If you're near a campus such a KTH or Stockholm Universitet, you'll be able to make use of the main libraries (biblioteket). They're usually open to the public and provide quiet rooms, small group study rooms, stacks, and other collaborative areas. Here, you may also be able to find a cheap dagens lunch! Aside from school campuses, you should check out the National Library of Sweden, along with the accompanying park. While the library itself provides a nice public study spot, you should be advised that no large bags are allowed. You'll have to check these at the entrance and bring your laptop/notebook in with you. Most of the time, I find myself reading in the park surrounding the library; it provides a nice tranquil escape from the bustling city around it.

### Getting Around
A common point of contention between European cities and west is the access to public transportation. I must agree that, at least empirically, it is far easier to get around here than, say, California (which is of comparable size to Sweden as a whole). If you have access to an SL (metro) card, you are no further than a few minutes from anywhere in the city. This is characteristic of any devloped city, though. Where the public transportation really shines is <i>outside</i> of Stockholm itself. A combination of SL lines, bus lines, and train lines permeate the country en masse, making it easy to get just about anywhere you want by ground transportation alone.

### Meeting People
The stereotype that Swedes are largely reserved and not-so-outgoing is, as I've found it, largely true. It can be quite a burden to meet new people here, especially the Swedes. There are many outlets that I've found provide ample opportunity to meet new people, though! As a student, lingering around libraries and campuses will grant you the advantage of meeting other, usually sociable, students. Moreover, the nightlife here in Stockholm is bustling with people from all demographics, and bars/clubs are a perfect opportunity to meet people. Alcohol, after all, makes everybody more sociable in general. Just be outoging, respectful, and willing to learn from people, and you should have no problems!

### Affordability
As with any city, it can be expensive to do just about anything. Specifically with food, it can be hard for most to stay on budget. Most grocery stores (e.g. ICA) are decently affordable, so cooking may be your most affordable option. Aside from this, there are many fast food options (e.g. Max, McDonald's, etc.) available and food trucks sprinkled throughout the city. My last recommendation is for the Too Good To Go app, in which you can save anywhere from 50% to 80% on food such a day-olds from restaurants, bakeries, and the likes.

### Conclusion
Stockholm is a vibrant destination for students, but much like anywhere in the world, there is some nuance to acclimatizing there. I hope that, through this article, I've provided some insight that makes it easier for you!
