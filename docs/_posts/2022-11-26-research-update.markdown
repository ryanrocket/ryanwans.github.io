An update on my recent research endeavors and future plans.

For the past 6 months or so I've been working on a collaborative effort between the University of Michigan, NIST, and a few other institutions such as Google. This has mostly been in an effort to further characterize the SKY130 process, which we have been doing through the OpenFASOC project. While there are a few portions of this project that I've been contributing to, the most notable is the characterization of planar inductors and some VCO test structures. I've put a relevent photo of the final layout below.

My most recent publication on the matter is not a paper, but rather a notebook that was designed for IEEE's 2023 International Solid State Circuits Conference (ISSCC). This notebook outlines the design methodology and approach I used to design the test structures. You can find the notebook [here](https://github.com/ryanrocket/sscs-ose-code-a-chip.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/LCVCO%20Notebook/VCONotebook.ipynb). 

## Future Plans & Efforts

There are a few projects in regards to the recently unveiled GF180MCU process that I've been cooking up for a few weeks now. I've be working closesly with the OpenFASOC group and others to realize these, and more updates will be coming soon as these evolve. I'm excited to see what's possible with this new PDK and the open source toolchain. I won't/can't say too much about these projects yet, but stay tuned for updates. 

In addition to the usual RFIC design, I've also been exploring some deeper spaces in mathematics; mostly pertaining to number thoery and topology. Professor Terence Tao has been a huge inspiration for me in this regard, and I've been trying to learn as much as I can from his lectures and books. While my lack of education in the field (for now) has been a bit of a hindrance, I've been able to make some progress in my understanding of these topics. I've been working on a few projects in this regard, and I hope to be able to share some of these in the near future. 

For now, I'll try to regularly update this blog with news from the GF180MCU research as it becomes available, as well as any other interesting topics I come across. The blog is less of a social media platform and more of a place for me to share my thoughts and ideas. I enjoy being able to vent my thoughts and ideas in this way, and I hope you enjoy reading them as well; though it is certainly not the purpose.
